# SimpleAccordion
A simple implementation of an accordion using UITableView.

I had the idea to add an accordion to my portfolio after my team had to build one.
The construction of the accordion was really difficult and the maintenance was even worse. At the time I was working on integrating our module with our super-app via deep-link and handling all the dependency injections to the module, but I was interested in how this component was built and how we could improve it.

After helping and refactoring the accordion from my project I decided to use this knowledge and build this one.
